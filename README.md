# SC-OBC Module V1 FPGA Development Environment

This repository manages the FPGA development environment for the **SC-OBC Module V1**, a high-end on-board computer in Space Cubics' *High-Extensibility and High-Reliability OBC* series.

The SC-OBC Module V1 is built around the **AMD Versal AI Edge VE2302** as its main processor. In addition, a **Microchip IGLOO2** device is implemented as a safety processor to perform health monitoring of the main processor. The hardware is composed of radiation-tolerant devices and industrial-grade components that have been verified for high radiation resistance, ensuring a highly reliable system in space applications.

This repository provides development support for both the Versal and IGLOO2 platforms.
